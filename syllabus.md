### Course Description

Data visulization makes it easier for researchers to communicate ideas and findings to thier peers and the public. Producing your own effective plots from data will allow you to understand plots made by others and identify what are effecitve and ineffective methods for data visualization. In this course, we will discuss what we mean by data visualization, what our goals as scientists are and should be, what tools are available to present/visualize your data using the software "R", and how to critique/evaluate presented data. This colloquium course is one is series of required courses provided to graduate students in the department of plant pathology, however, many plant science students will benefit from the information presented here. Colloquium class topics change each semester per the direction of the instructors.   


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic biology to provide context for exercises.


### Purpose of Course

As scientists and data consumers we are exposed to data visualization every single day. Whether the data is presented as a chart describing everyone’s favorite ice cream, a figure showing the change in the stock market over time, or an illustration in a popular science magazine demonstrating the more recent advance in our understanding of black holes and astrophysics, everyone single of us must interpret, develop, and communicate thoughts and data in clear, understandable, and aesthetically-pleasing ways. But how many of us stop to consider the underlying principles of how we present our data? Whether our intended messages are being conveyed accurately? Or whether we’re being misled by seemingly plausible sounding explanations of data depictions in erroneous ways? Join us on this semester’s adventure to discuss these topics and others including: research reproducibility, data storage, and data carpentry. 


### Course Objectives and Goals

After completing this colloquium students will be empowered to:

* Understand what data visualization and how its implemented to convey an author’s intended message 
* Know basic rules/guidelines to follow accurately convey data with out misleading or distorting data  
* Be familiar with different tools and applications that can help you design attractive and compelling data visualizations 
* Have a sound grasp of data management strategies and increased comfort with data storage and accessibility  
* Be familiar with R data carpentry tools DPLYER and the TIDYverse suite of applications for data manipulation 
* Improve your ability to design compelling visual presentations that delivery your message while remaining accessible to scientists and the public  


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered, approach, because
learning to program and work with data requires actively working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I think they
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in
knowing more take a look at this website:
(https://teach.ufl.edu/resource-library/flipped-classroom/).


### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Classes will
involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve. For more challenging topics class may start with 20-30
minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.


## Course Policies

### Special Policies for 2020

It has been a long, exhausting, year and it will continue to be so for many of us.
My goal is to help you learn as much as you can, while recognizing that most people have more limitations and less energy than usual.

The course is being taught online for the first time due to the pandemic.
To provide maximum flexibility the course material can be engaged with in three ways:

1. Fully synchronous: Attend class during the scheduled class periods. Follow each lesson, which combine video lectures and exercises, during the class periods and ask for help as you run into questions. This is the closest approximation to how the course normally runs in-person.
2. Synchronous Q&A: Follow each lesson before class, watching the videos and doing the exercises you can. Stop if you get confused. Come to class during the class periods and ask for help on challenges you encountered.
3. Asynchronous: Follow the lessons online and ask for help via Piazza. This is the least ideal approach because the course is generally based around the benefits of direct student-instructor interaction to work through misunderstandings, but we'll do our best to make it work for you.

The course always has flexible deadline policies (see below) and will continue to do so to support students learning under these difficult circumstances.
There is an automatic (no request needed) 48 hour extension on all assignments for those who need it.
If you need more time just let me know.
You never need to disclose personal information to me to get an extension. Just let me know how long you need.

### Class Recording

Our class sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded.  If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded.  If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live. The chat will not be recorded or shared. As in all courses, unauthorized recording and unauthorized sharing of recorded materials is prohibited.

### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class often struggle to learn the
material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.


### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for
the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension.
However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when
possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up
if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted.
Assignments turned in after the 48 hour grace period without an extension will be
be graded with a 20% penalty.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Eastern Time.
This timing allows you to be finished with one week's material before starting the next week's material.
Assignments should be submitted via either RStudio Cloud (for R assignments) or Canvas (for other assignments).

### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops (see [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup)
for installation instructions). Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


### Materials and Supplies Fees

There are no materials and supplies fees for this course.


## UF Policies


### University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities

The Disability Resource Center coordinates the needed accommodations of students
with disabilities. This includes registering disabilities, recommending academic
accommodations within the classroom, accessing special adaptive computer
equipment, providing interpretation services and mediating faculty-student
disability related issues.Students requesting classroom accommodation must first
register with the Dean of Students Office. The Dean of Students Office will
provide documentation to the student who must then provide this documentation to
the Instructor when requesting accommodation0001 Reid Hall, 352-392-8565,
www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/

My policy: If you are in my class I want to help you learn and will happily work
with you to make the learning environment equitable for you and others.


### Online Course Evaluation Process

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available at https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/. Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or via https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/. Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/.


### University Policy on Academic Misconduct

Academic honesty and integrity are fundamental values of the University
community. Students should be sure that they understand the UF Student Honor
Code at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/students.php.


### Netiquette and Communication Courtesy

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common
courtesy in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.


### Academic Honesty

As a student at the University of Florida, you have committed yourself to uphold
the Honor Code, which includes the following pledge:“We, the members of the
University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the
highest standards of honesty and integrity.”You are expected to exhibit behavior
consistent with this commitment to the UF academic community, and on all work
submitted for credit at the University of Florida, the following pledge is
either required or implied: "On my honor, I have neither given nor received
unauthorized aid in doing this assignment."

It is assumed that you will complete all work independently in each course
unless the instructor provides explicit permission for you to collaborate on
course tasks (e.g. assignments, papers, quizzes, exams). Furthermore, as part of
your obligation to uphold the Honor Code, you should report any condition that
facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. It is your individual
responsibility to know and comply with all university policies and procedures
regarding academic integrity and the Student Honor Code.Violations of the Honor
Code at the University of Florida will not be tolerated. Violations will be
reported to the Dean of Students Office for consideration of disciplinary
action. For more information regarding the Student Honor Code, please see:

### Software Use

All faculty, staff and students of the university are required and expected to
obey the laws and legal agreements governing software use. Failure to do so can
lead to monetary damages and/or criminal penalties for the individual violator.
Because such violations are also against university policies and rules,
disciplinary action will be taken as appropriate.


### Student Privacy

There are federal laws protecting your privacy with regards to grades earned in
courses and on individual assignments.  For more information, please see:
