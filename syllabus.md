### Course Description

Colloquium is a required course – all graduate students in the department of plant pathology are required to take a minimum of four semesters per degree. Colloquium class topics change each semester per the direction of the instructors. This semester, the topic is data visualization. We will discuss what we mean by data visualization, what our goals as scientists are and should be, what tools are available to present/visualize your data, and how to critique/evaluate presented data.  


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic biology to provide context for exercises.


### Purpose of Course

As scientists and data consumers we are exposed to data visualization every single day. Whether the data is presented as a chart describing everyone’s favorite ice cream, a figure showing the change in the stock market over time, or an illustration in a popular science magazine demonstrating the more recent advance in our understanding of black holes and astrophysics, everyone single of us must interpret, develop, and communicate thoughts and data in clear, understandable, and aesthetically-pleasing ways. But how many of us stop to consider the underlying principles of how we present our data? Whether our intended messages are being conveyed accurately? Or whether we’re being misled by seemingly plausible sounding explanations of data depictions in erroneous ways? Join us on this semester’s adventure to discuss these topics and others including: research reproducibility, data storage, and data carpentry. 


### Course Objectives and Goals

After completing this colloquium students will be empowered to:

* Understand what data visualization and how its implemented to convey an author’s intended message 
* Know basic rules/guidelines to follow accurately convey data with out misleading or distorting data  
* Be familiar with different tools and applications that can help you design attractive and compelling data visualizations 
* Have a sound grasp of data management strategies and increased comfort with data storage and accessibility  
* Be familiar with R data carpentry tools DPLYER and the TIDYverse suite of applications for data manipulation 
* Improve your ability to design compelling visual presentations that delivery your message while remaining accessible to scientists and the public  


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered, approach, because
learning to program and work with data requires actively working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I think they
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in
knowing more take a look at this great
[info-graphic](https://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom-2/).


### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Classes will
involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve. For more challenging topics class may start with 20-30
minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.


## Course Policies

### Special Policies for 2020

It has been a long, exhausting, year and it will continue to be so for many of us.
My goal is to help you learn as much as you can, while recognizing that most people have more limitations and less energy than usual.

The course is being taught online for the first time due to the pandemic.
To provide maximum flexibility the course material can be engaged with in three ways:

1. Fully synchronous: Attend class during the scheduled class periods. Follow each lesson, which combine video lectures and exercises, during the class periods and ask for help as you run into questions. This is the closest approximation to how the course normally runs in-person.
2. Synchronous Q&A: Follow each lesson before class, watching the videos and doing the exercises you can. Stop if you get confused. Come to class during the class periods and ask for help on challenges you encountered.
3. Asynchronous: Follow the lessons online and ask for help via Piazza. This is the least ideal approach because the course is generally based around the benefits of direct student-instructor interaction to work through misunderstandings, but we'll do our best to make it work for you.

The course always has flexible deadline policies (see below) and will continue to do so to support students learning under these difficult circumstances.
There is an automatic (no request needed) 48 hour extension on all assignments for those who need it.
If you need more time just let me know.
You never need to disclose personal information to me to get an extension. Just let me know how long you need.

### Class Recording

Our class sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded.  If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded.  If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live. The chat will not be recorded or shared. As in all courses, unauthorized recording and unauthorized sharing of recorded materials is prohibited.

### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class often struggle to learn the
material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.


### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for
the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension.
However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when
possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up
if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted.
Assignments turned in after the 48 hour grace period without an extension will be
be graded with a 20% penalty.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Eastern Time.
This timing allows you to be finished with one week's material before starting the next week's material.
Assignments should be submitted via either RStudio Cloud (for R assignments) or Canvas (for other assignments).

### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops (see [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup)
for installation instructions). Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


### Materials and Supplies Fees

There are no materials and supplies fees for this course.


## UF Policies


### University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities

The Disability Resource Center coordinates the needed accommodations of students
with disabilities. This includes registering disabilities, recommending academic
accommodations within the classroom, accessing special adaptive computer
equipment, providing interpretation services and mediating faculty-student
